# Personal-Portfolio-Website

🌐 Personal Portfolio Website
This repository contains the complete source code for my personal portfolio website — a professionally designed and responsive web portfolio that highlights who I am, what I do, and how to get in touch with me.

🚀 About the Project
The goal of this portfolio is to create a centralized platform to:

Present my technical skills, projects, and certifications

Act as a digital resume that is accessible from anywhere

Showcase my experience with front-end development and web design

Provide interactive navigation between sections such as About Me, Projects, Certifications, and Contact

Offer easy contact access via a working contact form integrated with Formspree

🎯 Key Features

Section-Based Layout:

Certifications Section: Visually styled certificate cards with "Show All / Show Less" toggle.

Projects Section: Highlights projects with GitHub links and project descriptions.

Contact Section: Fully functional contact form with email integration.

Smooth Scrolling and navigation through internal links.

Interactive Buttons and hover effects for better UX.

Modern Aesthetic: Clean typography, balanced color palette (aqua, dark blue, yellow accents), and subtle animations.

🛠️ Tech Stack

🧠 Inspiration
This project helped me explore hands-on implementation of HTML/CSS layout techniques, form integrations, and user-focused web design. It also acts as a personal branding tool for my career in tech and data science.
